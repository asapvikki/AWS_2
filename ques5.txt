2. security group of instance A : SSH PORT 22 from My IP
    
   security group of instance B : SSH PORT 22 from sg-id of security group of instance A

3. go to the instanceA
   1.ssh-add -k <private-key.pem>
   2.ssh -A ec2-user@<public-ip-of-instanceA>

4. now connected to instanceA 
   instanceA: ssh-keygen
   instanceA: cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh ec2-user@<private-ip-of-instanceB>

   passwordless ssh is now setup between instanceA and instanceB

5. we can test the connection
